    The Triforce from The Legend of Zelda series has a symbolism of abilities present with the three main characters of
    each game. Three abilities of which are Courage, Wisdom and Power, which are reflected in Link, Zelda and Ganon
    respectively. Ganon is the most common reincarnation of evil, though there are other villians that strive for power
    and are influenced by Ganon.

        <h2>The Triforce's Orign</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triforce" target="_blank">The Triforce</a>
            is depicted as the combined spirit of the three goddesses who created the land of Hyrule, each “third” of
            the Triforce representing their qualities of Power, Wisdom and Courage. Due to the Triforce's connection
            with the Royal Family of Hyrule, it is part of the Hyrule Royal Family's signature bird crest and the
            Triforce symbol is found on various objects and items.

            <a href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Golden_Goddesses" target="_blank">The Golden Goddesses</a>
            , also known as the Old Gods,are Din, the Goddess of Power, Nayru, the Goddess of Wisdom, and Farore, the
            Goddess of Courage, the chief gods and creators of the land that becomes the Kingdom of Hyrule and the
            extended world that it resides in. It is understood that the Golden Goddesses have always existed, and that
            they are omnipotent and eternal.

        <h2>Ganon - The Reincarnated Evil</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Ganon" target="_blank">Ganon</a>
            is the possessor of the Triforce of Power, imbued with the essence of the Goddess Din. This divine relic
            makes Ganon unimaginably strong and grants him boundless mystical power, making him a grave threat to the
            land of Hyrule and the world. Additionally, Ganon is the source of darkness. As stated in prophecy, the only
            one capable of defeating Ganon is the Hero who is chosen by the Goddesses. As the manifestation of the Demon
            King Demise's hatred for the Goddess and her Chosen Hero (or, according to the Hyrule Historia, the
            reincarnation of Demise himself) Ganon is destined to eternally reincarnate to pursue world domination.

            <a href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Din_(Goddess)" target="_blank">Din</a>
            has the essence that constitutes the Triforce of Power, which affords Ganon his great power and mystical
            abilities. To a much smaller extent, Din's power can also be invoked by a powerful sorcerer. Her essence is
            often represented by fire as exemplified in the magic spell Din's Fire. According to the Great Deku Tree in
            Ocarina of Time, Din, "with her strong flaming arms, cultivated the land and created the red earth." Upon
            departure, they created the Triforce, the embodiment of the goddesses' divine essence, and left it within
            the Sacred Realm.

            is the mortal incarnation of the Goddess Hylia. Carrying on this divine blood, her female descendants are
            often named after her and are always the crown princess of Hyrule throughout its history. Several princesses
            within the bloodline are also the possessor of the Triforce of Wisdom, imbued with the essence of the
            Goddess Nayru.The essence of Nayru affords each Zelda divine wisdom, allowing them to discern the wisest
            decisions, especially in situations concerning the welfare of Hyrule. It grants them a myriad of mystical
            abilities, including the ability to heal others.

            wisdom and mystical abilities. To a much smaller extent, Nayru's essence can also be invoked by a powerful
            sorcerer. Her essence provides a protective shield of light when the spell Nayru's Love is cast. According
            to Ocarina of Time, Nayru "poured her wisdom onto the earth and gave the spirit of law to the world." Upon
            departure, the three goddesses created the Triforce, the embodiment of their divine essence, and left it
