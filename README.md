# TriforceZeldaSite
This is code for a small project I made. It's a web-page that simply explains the Triforce from the Legend of Zelda series. It's especially useful for newcomers to the series, or people interested in general videogame lore. Not really set-up online more of an offline exercise to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS.
